# Vibe Archer Game - Skunkworks Edition üèéÔ∏èü¶®

## What is this Glorious Mess?

Welcome to the... uh... *mostly* functional Vibe Archer Game! Built during the [** 2025 Vibe Coding Game Jam 2025**](https://jam.pieter.com/) (shoutout!), this is our magnum opus... or maybe just an opus. It was lovingly (and sometimes frustratingly) cobbled together with the help of our AI coding buddy, Cline.

## How to Play

1.  **Look Around:** Click to lock mouse,look around. Try not to get dizzy.
2.  **Click to shoot**
4.  **Defend the Tower:** Green and Red blobs (aka "enemies") will shamble towards your magnificent tower (the grey blocky thing). Shoot them before they bonk the tower too much.
5.  **Survive:** Keep the tower's health above zero. There's no player health to worry about because, frankly, we didn't get around to it. You're invincible! Lucky you.
6.  **Waves:** More blobs will come. Good luck.

## The Honest Truth

Look, we aimed for the stars and maybe hit the ceiling fan. This isn't quite the epic saga we envisioned. There are missing sounds, questionable physics alignments (don't look too closely at the enemy hitboxes!), and features left on the cutting room floor.

*However*, we learned a *ton* about building stuff with AI, wrestling with Three.js and Cannon-es, and the sheer chaos of game jams. It was a blast, even if the final product is a bit... skunkworks. üòâ

Thanks for checking it out!
